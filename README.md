#What is this?

This is the repository for the Healer ecosystem Core API.

#What is Healer?

Healer is a technology initiative being developed to support the efforts of medical aid workers worldwide. We manage patients, cases, scheduling, and other types of associated data and logistics.

In short, if you provide charitable medical services, Healer's goal is to help provide you the type of information and workflow that enables you to do that work better than you ever imagined possible.
